# This code finds all faces in a list of images using the CNN model.
#
# This demo is for the _special case_ when you need to find faces in LOTS of images very quickly and all the images
# are the exact same size. This is common in video processing applications where you have lots of video frames
# to process.
#
# If you are processing a lot of images and using a GPU with CUDA, batch processing can be ~3x faster then processing
# single images at a time. But if you aren't using a GPU, then batch processing isn't going to be very helpful.
#
# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read the video file.
# OpenCV is *not* required to use the face_recognition library. It's only required if you want to run this
# specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.

    # Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color (which face_recognition uses)
